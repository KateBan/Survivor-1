1. How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
The Colorizr gem uses "class_eval" to implement the "create_color" method.
Also, it can use "define_method". The way to test it is to uncomment
the "create_color" method that implements it.
To call each of the color methods "sample_colors" method used "send".

2. How long did you spend working on this project?
About 4 hours.

3. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I liked that I was able to use both "class_eval" and "define_method." 
to achieve the same goal. I feel that I 
learn more and more about Ruby with every project. That is awesome!

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I need to continue practise metaprogramming, try to use the 
other methods like "method_missing."
